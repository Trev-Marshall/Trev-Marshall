## Coding and flipping like it's no one's business😪
For that past two years, at the time of typing this, I have been studying web development without holding back! Within that year I have landed my first clients outside of my own network and created lasting connections within my current internship (update: already on my third internship build research tools for a womens hospital in React and Django! Also, I am studying kubernetes!).
## Tech stack ♨️
Since learning React I have stuck with it with the hopes of branching to other frameworks if needed. I've experimented with the backend ranging from .Net MVC, Core, and Entity Framework all the way to Django and it's REST Framework, which is what I am currently building my Headspace web application off of! 
In the recent months I have worked heavily with the Django React stack which means I'm finally applying my BEST skills to real world projects that are making a difference!
## Goals 💯
The world works in mysterious ways and I want to ride that wave. I work well with others and have experience with people in different timezones. If you need me to work on the frontend or the backend of any project I would love to get down and dirty. Connect with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-marshall-0b17121b2/) and send me a message.
