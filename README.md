## Coding and flipping like it's no one's businessüò™
For that past two years, at the time of typing this, I have been developing software without holding back! Within a year I landed my first clients outside of my own network and created lasting connections within my current position (update: time is passing too fast, 'current position' was two years and 5 internships ago!).
## Tech stack ‚ô®Ô∏è
Since learning React I branched out to Angular. I've experimented with the backend ranging from .Net Core and Django and it's REST Framework, which is what I am currently using in multiple positions and side projects! 
In the recent months I have worked heavily with the Django React stack which means I'm finally applying my BEST skills to real world projects that are making a difference! Angular, D3.js, and TypeScript are also skills familiar to me :)
## Goals üíØ
The world works in mysterious ways and I want keep it that way. I want to branch out and gain experience working with all types of tech. It's likely that the stack I'm working with today may not be the stack I'm working with when I start my next position. No matter what I do I'll be happy as long as I'm learning to create solutions and work that offers value to those who use it!
