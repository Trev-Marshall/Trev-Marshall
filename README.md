## Coding and flipping like it's no one's businessüò™
For that past two years, at the time of typing this, I have been studying software development without holding back! Within a year I have landed my first clients outside of my own network and created lasting connections within my current internship (update: time is passing too fast, 'current internship' was a year and 3 internships ago!).
## Tech stack ‚ô®Ô∏è
Since learning React I have stuck with it with the hopes of branching to other frameworks if needed. I've experimented with the backend ranging from .Net Core to Django and it's REST Framework, which is what I am currently using in multiple positions! 
In the recent months I have worked heavily with the Django React stack which means I'm finally applying my BEST skills to real world projects that are making a difference! Angular, D3.js, and TypeScript are on my radar too : )
## Goals üíØ
The world works in mysterious ways and I want keep it that way. I want to branch out and gain experience working with all types of tech. It's likely the stack I'm working with today is not going to be stack I'm working with when I start to specialize. No matter what I do I'll be happy as long as I'm learning to create solutions and work that offers value to those who use it!
