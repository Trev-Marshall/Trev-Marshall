## Coding and flipping like it's no one's businessüò™
For that past year, at the time of typing this, I have been studying web development without holding back! Within that year I have landed my first clients outside of my own network and created lasting connections within my current internship.
## Tech stack ‚ô®Ô∏è
Since learning React I have stuck with it with the hopes of branching to other frameworks if needed. I've experimented with the backend ranging from .Net MVC, Core, and Entity Framework all the way to Django and it's REST Framework, which is what I am currently building my Headspace web application off of! 
When freelancing and working with clients I most often work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but I am eager to break out of these contraints and tackle the absolute living daylights out of React, finally applying my BEST skills to real world projects that are making a difference!
## Goals üíØ
The world works in mysterious ways and I want to ride that wave. I work well with others and have experience with people in different timezones. If you need me to work on the frontend or the backend of any project I would love to get down and dirty. Connect with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-marshall-0b17121b2/) and send me a message.
